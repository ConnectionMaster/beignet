<h1>C++ Simulator</h1>

<p>The compiler can output both Gen ISA or C++ code that can be run directly on
CPUs. The C++ simulator (which is technically run and owned by the run-time, not
the compiler) basically loads a shared object, get the kernel code from it and
run it. </p>

<p>The role of the compiler is to generate this shared object.</p>

<p>Most of the code related to the C++ simulator can be found in:
<code>src/backend/sim_context.*pp</code></p>

<p><code>src/backend/sim_program.*pp</code></p>

<p><code>src/backend/sim_program.h</code></p>

<p><code>src/backend/sim/sim_vector.*pp</code></p>

<p>This files are responsible for building the C++ string for the kernel and to
compile a shared object from it. Once done and through the C API specified by
<code>backend/program.h</code>, the run-time can load and run the compiled code very
similarly to how the Gen kernel itself.</p>

<p>Files in <code>backend/sim</code> contains the actual C++ code used when compiled the
GenIR. They are basically a set of C++ templates and macros whose the goal is to
make the kernel code generation really easy.</p>
